# Estimating-Implied-Volatility-using-Non-Parametric-Methods

Overview

The accurate modeling of the implied volatility surface is crucial for option pricing, trading, and hedging. Traditional mathematical and machine-learning approaches often produce point estimates that can be misleading due to imperfections in market data. To address this, we employ Gaussian Processes (GPs), a Bayesian non-parametric method that generates posterior distributions of implied volatility functions. This allows us to quantify uncertainty and provide confidence intervals, offering a more robust approach to volatility estimation.
